EJS Syntax Reference
====================

EJS is designed to be flexible and easy-to-write, but without too much
abstractions to cover up the HTML base.

Table of contents
-----------------

- Basic format
- Delimiters
- Starting tags
- `<%=`: Escaped output
- `<%-`: Unescaped output
- `<%#`: Comments
- `<%`: Scriptlet
- `<%_`: Scriptlet, removes all preceding whitespace
- Ending tags
- `%>`: Regular ending tag
- `-%>`: Removes trailing newline
- `_%>`: Removes all trailing whitespace
- Literal tags
- Including other files
- JavaScript `include()` function
- Copyright


Basic format
------------

An EJS “tag” is the primary functioning unit in an EJS template. With the
exception of the literal tags, all tags are formed by the following format:

<pre>&lt;<em>starting</em> <em>content</em> <em>closing</em>&gt;</pre>

The spaces between *starting* and *content*, and *content* and *closing* are
not required; they are recommended though for readability.

Delimiters
----------

The *starting* and *closing* tags contain a special string called the
delimiter. In this document, all tags are shown using the `%` delimiter, which
is the default. You can, however, change that to your liking. See
https://github.com/mde/ejs#custom-delimiters for more information on how to
change it.
